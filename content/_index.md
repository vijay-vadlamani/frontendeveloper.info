## Introduction
Hi, I'm Vijay. I have been a frontend developer for over 5 years now.
I have always been overwhelmed by the sheer volume of all the new frameworks that come out in the javascript domain each year. Finally with a lot of failed attempts to keep up with all the frameworks I have given up on the idea of mastering all the frameworks and instead learn the JavaScript language better. In my opinion if I am able to understand and apply how javascript works under the hood and learn the in and outs of the language it would be far more beneficial than to just keep up with the frameworks.

I recently started looking around for a one stop shop learning platform for frontend developers who are preparing for interviews. Unfortunately there is just too much information available and it is spread all over the place, so I decided to attempt to write a comprehensive guide to all the important topics that are potentially asked during an interview.

In this blog I will mostly be focusing on whiteboarding interviews but eventually would like to tackle a few take home challenges and how to approach them as well.

Topics we will be covering in this blog
- [X] What is whiteboarding and how to practice
-[] Big-O
-[] Data Structures
-[] Algorithms
-[] System Design
-[] Take home projects
-[] Misc.


[^1]: I do not claim to be an expert, I do have experience in frontend development but there are numerous gaps in my knowledge. Hopefully in this attempt I will be able to reduce the gap and also help someone who is looking to learn.
